# Databricks notebook source
# MAGIC %md The purpose of this notebook is to deploy the model to be used by the QA Bot accelerator.  This notebook is available at https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/diy-llm-qa-bot.

# MAGIC %md ##Introduction
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this notebook, we will deploy the custom model registered with MLflow in the prior notebook and deploy it to Databricks model serving ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/model-serving/index.html)|[Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/machine-learning/model-serving/)).  Databricks model serving provides containerized deployment options for registered models thought which authenticated applications can interact with the model via a REST API.  This provides MLOps teams an easy way to deploy, manage and integrate their models with various applications.

# MAGIC %md ##Step 1: Deploy Model Serving Endpoint
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Models may typically be deployed to model sharing endpoints using either the Databricks workspace user-interface or a REST API.  Because our model depends on the deployment of a sensitive environment variable, we will need to leverage a relatively new model serving feature that is currently only available via the REST API.
